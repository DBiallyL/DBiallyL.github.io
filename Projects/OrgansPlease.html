                    In Organs, Please you play as a doctor, and must look through patients in need of an organ to decide who gets the transplant and who stays on the waiting list. Players are asked to make a series of tough ethical decisions as they explore the lives of patients, learn about the process of organ transplants, and gain insight into their own morals.

                    I led a team including myself and 3 other students to create this project for my Software Design and Development class at Macalester College. We utilized Agile development practices to continuously progress and improve our game in response to user tests. I implemented the phone's UI/UX and contributed to many of the paper UX functionalities, and went through many cycles of testing and development to ensure the interactions felt intuitive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We drew inspiration from games like Papers, Please and Death and Taxes to create this top-down ethical-decision game. We wanted the players' environment to feel calm and clean, to contrast with the stress of making life-altering decisions. I was responsible for the game's sound design, as well as many of the interactable art assets we used.
