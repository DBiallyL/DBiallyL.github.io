                I created this project with a partner as a capstone-level project for my Internet Computing course at Macalester College. We wanted to create a blogging platform designed around sharing and discussing music. Our final product allows users to both find and embed music in blog posts using the YouTube API, and provided a time-based comment functionality such that users could click on a comment and be brought to the appropriate time in the song.
            </p>

                I implemented most of the functionality surrounding creating and viewing individual blog posts. This included designing UI and visuals for blog pages, writing script to allow for flexible and responsive post creation, working with the YouTube API to manipulate embedded songs, and using a MongoDB Database to securely store and retrieve blog posts.
